Here's the spec for the feed we receive from the AP, along with some sample files from today's news.

Write a simple python library that does the following, given the XML feed for a category:
  - Return a list of each story in the feed, where the story (can be Class or
    Dict, doesn't matter) has the following fields:
    - Unique ID
    - Title: Plain text, no HTML
    - Summary: Use the plain text (no HTML) from the first paragraph,
      without the location and author information (e.g. NEW YORK (AP) --)
    - Date
    - Images: List of images in the article, with each having:
      - Caption (not including any credit information, like AP Photo)
      - Credit information
      - URL to the image
    - Content: The HTML content of the article. Strip the surrounding <div>
      such that it's just a sequence of <p> tags. Also:
      - Add class='first' to the first paragraph
      - Add class='last' to the final paragraph

Include doctests
